    <h1>Personas and Storyboarding</h1>
    <h3>1. Preparation and Interface Selection</h3>
    <p class = "text">
      Over 10 million people use the Shanghai subway system on an average workday. Thus, the Shanghai Transportation Card, which allows users to conveniently swipe in and out of stations, is a must-have in the city. Using a transportation card also means having to top-up the card, which brings us to the machine most commonly used for topping-up transportation cards in Shanghai. These machines are located in every subway station, and are exactly the same. In this project, I evaluate Shanghai’s Transportation Card Management Machine by observing users using the machine, interviewing a subset of those users, creating personas based on these users, and then plotting the journey of one of these personas by illustrating a storyboard. 
      <br><br>
      First, let’s take a look at Shanghai’s Transportation Card Management Machine:
    </p>

    <br><br>

    <p class = "text">
      This machine allows users to top-up their transportation cards in a self-service fashion. Though the machine also allows users to buy and return transportation cards, they are very rare use cases, and so I chose topping-up as the only use case for analysis. The machine has a message board across the top for any announcements, and a touch screen below the message board which allows the user to make selections. Below the touch screen, there is a QR code scanner for mobile payment, and a number keypad for entering bank information. Across the left, there are two slots: one for receiving receipts and one for inserting bank cards. Finally, on the bottom right side of the machine, there is a compartment with a transparent flap, which holds the transportation card. The flap locks itself once the top-up process begins and only unlocks when the process is over or is canceled. 
      <br><br>
    </p>

    <h3>2. Recording Observations</h3>
    <p class = "text">I observed about 40 users using this machine, across six different subway stations, at different points during the day. I picked subway stations that varied in terms of the wealthiness of the neighborhood where the station was located, the crowdedness of the station, and how close the station was to downtown Shanghai. This was to ensure that I was observing people from as wide of a range of backgrounds as possible. 

        <br><br>
        I also collected data at three main times: during rush hour on the weekdays, during regular hours on the weekdays, and on the weekends/holidays, to try to run into people who were using the machine for varying purposes. Here were my key takeaways from my observations:
        <br><br>
        <ul class = "list">
            <li class = "bullet">Not a single user I observed chose to use the bank card payment method</li>
            <li class = "bullet">Though I saw a couple machines that were “Out of Service”, I never saw people waiting or lining up to use the machine. This was the case even during rush hour and on the weekends, which are the busiest subway hours. </li>
            <li class = "bullet">Most users come to the machine after attempting to swipe into the station and realizing that their balance is too low</li>
            <li class = "bullet">Users who spent more time on the machine often forgot/didn’t know where to put their transportation card. Instead of placing their card in the compartment, they typically tried placing it under the red scanner, or into the bank card slot, first. </li>
        </ul>

        <br><br>
      </p>
      <p class = "text">
        I generated the following list of questions to find out more about the users’ thoughts, motivations, intentions, and emotions while using the interface. I interviewed a total of five users. Note that both the questions were first written in English, but were asked in Chinese. The answers were given in Chinese, and then translated to English. Here are the questions, as well as a summary of the responses collected from the five interviewed users:

        <br><br>

        <ol class = "list">
            <li class = "bullet">How often do you use the subway?</li>
            <p>Three of the users interviewed use the subway every day. Another takes the subway a couple times a month, and another came from another province, and thus hasn’t taken the subway in almost a year</p>
            <li class = "bullet">How often do you use the Transportation Card Management Machine, and for what?</li>
            <p>The frequency ranged from every week to every couple months to one interviewed user being a first time user of the machine. They all have only used the machine to top-cup their cards.</p>

            <li class = "bullet">What payment option do you typically use?</li>
            <p>All users said that they’ve only used the mobile payment method, since it’s by far the most common payment method throughout China. A couple the users laughed at the fact that a bank card option even existed.</p>
            <li class = "bullet">What was the first thing you did when you used the machine today? </li>
            <p>All four users who have experience with the machine said that interacting with the touch screen was the first thing they did, since they knew that was the first part of the process. The new user described observing the machine first, and then attempting to read the instructions drawn on top.</p>
            <li class = "bullet">How long did your experience with the machine take today?</li>
            <p>Three of the users said their experience lasted about 1-2 minutes. The other two users said theirs lasted about 4-5 minutes. The amount of time that a user spent on the machine was inversely correlated with the amount of experience a user had with the machine. </p>
            <li class = "bullet">When did you realize today that you needed to use this machine?</li>
            <p>All users mentioned that they typically don’t remember needing to top-up their transportation cards when entering the subway station. They realize that their balances are too low after attempting to swipe into the station, and have to walk back out to access this machine. Two of the frequent subway users mentioned that this could be really irritating especially during rush hour, when there is sometimes a long line through the security checkpoint that separates the machine and the swiping area. </p>
            <li class = "bullet">What are the main issues that you face when using the machine? </li>
            <p>
                An issue that multiple users brought up was the fact that the transportation card had to be placed inside a compartment during the entire process. This was something that users didn’t feel was very intuitive, especially since there were also two card slots, as well as a scanner, on the machine, which are more common methods of reading cards. One user mentioned that the instructions on the machine further complicated this issue, since the comic-like drawings depict the transportation card being inserted into a slot. 
                <br><br>
                One of the users mentioned that the compartment flap was at times an annoyance, since it would get stuck from time to time. This sometimes made it hard for the user to retrieve the card after the process.
                <br><br>
                Finally, one user brought up the fact that since there is already so much going on on the machine, the variety of colors on the machine adds to the perceived complexity of the machine, making it feel harder to use. 
                
            </p>
            <li class = "bullet">If you could improve one thing about the interface, what would it be?</li>
            <p>
                One user suggested completely removing the option of bank card payment, because “everyone in China is most used to mobile payment” and because removing this option would drastically reduce the complexity of the machine. Another user suggested updating the comic-drawings on the instructions to be more accurate. 
                <br><br>
                One user felt very strongly about the compartment, criticizing its unintuitive “look and feel” that made the machine confusing, especially for new users. The user also mentioned the occasionally faulty compartment flap, which frustrated more frequent users, especially when they were in a rush.
                <br><br>
                Two users mentioned moving the machine so that it is located after the security checkpoint, which would eliminate the inconvenience caused by having to walk out and back in of the security checkpoint after swiping and realizing that your transportation card doesn’t have enough funds. 
                
            </p>
        
        </ol>

    </p>
    <h3>3. Personas</h3>
    <p class = "text">
      Using the information I gathered from observations and interviews, I constructed two personas that represented the users I saw and spoke with. I constructed two four-quadrant empathy maps illustrating these personas. These are shown below, with accompanying descriptions of the personas below each empathy map.
    </p>
    <br><br>
    <div class="row">
        <div class="column">
          <img class = "personas" src="brian.jpg" style="width:100%">
        </div>
        <div class="column">
          <h4 class ="text" id = "brian" >Persona 1: Busy Brian</h4>
          <p class = "text">
              Busy Brian is a young banker working a 9-5 in Shanghai’s Financial District. Having grown up in the city, he is familiar with its subway system, and takes the subway on his way to and from work every weekday, during rush hour. 
              <br><br>
              Though Brian is familiar with the interface, he is often irritated by the fact that there is a security checkpoint between the subway’s swiping area and the transportation card machine. Having to walk out and back in of this checkpoint causes unexpected delays on his way to work, when rush hour often means a long line at the security checkpoint. Already often frustrated when using the machine to begin with, Brian sometimes also has to deal with the faulty compartment flap, which adds a couple frustrating minutes to his commute. 
              <br><br>
              Brian represents the frequent subway user already very familiar with the machine, who made up more than half of the users I observed and interviewed. These users prioritize speed and convenience. Though their familiarity with the machine lessens the average time they spend on it, unexpected inconveniences become especially irritating.

    <div class="row">
        <div class="column">
          <img class = "personas" src="vicky.jpg" style="width:100%">
        </div>
        <div class="column">
          <h4 class ="text" id = "vicky">Persona 2: Vacationing Vicky</h4>
          <p class = "text">
              Vacationing Vicky is visiting Shanghai for the third time this year. Knowing that taking the subway Shanghai is the most convenient way to get around, Vicky remembered to bring her transportation card that she purchased on her last visit. She passes security and attempts to swipe into the station, only to realize that her balance is too low, and so goes to use the machine for the first time. 
              <br><br>
              Completely unfamiliar with the interface, Vicky reads the instructions on the machine, which seems to have very helpful drawings. The drawings depict a card being inserted into a slot, so Vicky tries inserting her transportation card in each of the two slots, confused to find out that her card fits in neither. After waving her card under the red light, hoping that the light meant that her card would be scanned, Vicky finally realizes that her card needs to go into the compartment with a transparent flap. 
              <br><br>
              Vicky represents the new or very infrequent user of this machine. There are over 10 million people who take the subway each day, and nearly each of these people have had a “first interaction” with the machine at some point in their life, so the problems that Vicky faces in this interaction with the machine have been faced by many. The lack of affordances guiding a new user to the transportation card compartment, compounded by the confusion caused by the bank card slots and inaccurate drawings in the instructions, cause new users to struggle during their first experience with the machine. These users may not necessarily prioritize efficiency and speed, but simply wish to learn how to use the machine as fast as possible.

    <h3>4. Storyboarding</h3>
    <p class = "text">
        Using the Vacationing Vicky persona, I used Plot to create a storyboard plotting Vacationing Vicky’s user journey from start to end. 
        <br><br>
        For context, Vacationing Vicky is topping-up her transportation card for the first time, and successfully does so after a slight struggle.

    <h3>5. Afterthoughts</h3>
    <p class = "text">
      What I was most interested in about among my findings was the general negative attitude towards the card compartment. Placing the card inside a compartment unintuitive, especially next to two slots that seemed like they could welcome a transportation card. 
      <br><br>
      Some initial thoughts I had about the compartment were:
      <br><br>
      <ul class = "list">
          <li class = "bullet">The scanner is the bottom of the compartment, which resembles how Shanghai transportation cards are scanned. Inserting the card into a slot would make muchh less sense, since that's now how these cards are scanned</li>
          <li class = "bullet">I guess cards are put inside a locked compartment so the card stays in place throughout the entire transaction? </li>
          <li class = "bullet">Something about the compartment being in the lower right hand corner might also contribute to its "unintuitive feel". Maybe such an integral part of the machine should be placed closer to the middle?</li>
          <li class = "bullet">Though this is an inconvenience for new users, I wonder how long this issue persists for users. Maybe this doesn't need a fix, since people figure it out quickly anyway after struggling the first time </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <br><br>
    <p class = "text">
      And that's about it. Thoughh I would like to explore potential improvements to this interface, especially when it comes to the compartment, that lies beyond the scope of this project.
